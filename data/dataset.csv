Term,Answer
"Quadtree","(Outside sources) Definition: A spatial tree data structure where each internal node has exactly four children. Principle: It recursively decomposes a 2D image plane into four quadrants or regions until a criterion is met. Example: Efficient image compression or spatial indexing for fast object searching."
"Motion parallax","Definition: A depth cue derived from the relative apparent motion of objects in a scene. Principle: Objects that are closer to the observer cross the field of view faster than those further away. Example: Using the apparent velocity components in a motion field to recover 3D scene layouts."
"Otsu's method","Definition: An automated procedure for determining an optimal global threshold for image binarization. Principle: It exhaustively searches for the threshold value that minimizes the within-group variance between foreground and background pixels. Example: Separating dark and light pixels in a bimodal histogram of a bruised cherry image."
"RGB color space","Definition: An additive color model that represents colors through red, green, and blue intensities. Principle: Most visible colors can be produced by mixing three properly chosen primary light sources according to trichromatic theory. Example: Standard 24-bit representation of digital color images using 8 bits per channel."
"Background subtraction","Definition: A technique used to eliminate the image background and produce a mask of moving objects. Principle: Pixels in the current frame that deviate significantly from a dynamic or static background model are labeled as foreground. Example: Detecting moving pedestrians in a video sequence by updating a Mixture of Gaussian background model."
"Specular reflection","Definition: The mirror-like reflection of light from smooth or highly polished surfaces. Principle: The angle of incidence is equal to the angle of reflection, and the reflected light maintains the wavelength composition of the source. Example: Highly polished metals exhibiting 'shiny spots' or highlights that take the color of the illuminant."
"Time-of-flight camera","(Outside sources) Definition: A range imaging camera system that computes distance to objects. Principle: It calculates depth by measuring the time it takes for an emitted light pulse to travel to an object and return to the sensor. Example: Real-time 3D environment scanning for autonomous vehicle navigation or gaming."
"Structured light","Definition: A 3D perception method that uses known illumination patterns to measure surface shape. Principle: A projector replaces a camera in a stereo setup, projecting patterns that bend over surfaces to reveal 3D coordinates. Example: Computing 3D coordinates based on image points and the known geometry of a system using a laser stripe projector."
"Quadtree","(Outside sources) it is a data structure used to partition two-dimensional space by recursively subdividing it into four smaller quadrants."
"Motion parallax","It is a 3D cue where objects closer to the camera appear to move faster across the image plane than those further away."
"Otsu's method","It is an algorithm that automatically selects a segmentation threshold by minimizing the within-class variance of the image histogram."
"RGB color space","It is an additive color representation where red, green, and blue components are combined to create a final color perception."
"Background subtraction","It is a motion detection method that identifies foreground objects by finding pixels that differ from a modeled background frame."
"Specular reflection","It is the regular reflection of light from smooth surfaces where incident rays and reflected rays share the same angle relative to the surface normal."
"Time-of-flight camera","(Outside sources) It is a depth sensor that estimates distance to objects by measuring the travel time of a light signal."
"Structured light","It is a shape-recovery technique that projects known light patterns onto an object to calculate depth from the observed deformations."
